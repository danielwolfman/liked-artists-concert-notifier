# ðŸŽµ Spotify Favorite Artists Concert Notifier Bot ðŸŽµ

This bot, [@LikedArtistsConcertNotifierBot](https://t.me/LikedArtistsConcertNotifierBot), helps users track concerts for their favorite artists based on their Spotify library and sends personalized notifications via Telegram.

## Key Features:
- **Spotify Integration**: Automatically retrieves users' favorite artists based on their Spotify liked songs and top artists.
- **Concert Data**: Fetches real-time event data using the Ticketmaster API.
- **Precise Artist Matching**: Uses Spotify `attractionId` to ensure event searches return only the specific artists, not tribute bands or loosely related events.
- **Telegram Notifications**: Sends concert notifications directly to users via [@LikedArtistsConcertNotifierBot](https://t.me/LikedArtistsConcertNotifierBot).
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Keeps track of previously notified concerts to avoid sending repeat notifications.
- **User-Specific OAuth Authentication**: Each user authenticates with their own Spotify account, and their tokens are securely managed.

## How It Works:
1. **Spotify Authentication**: Users interact with the bot to enter their Spotify API credentials via OAuth.
2. **Subscribed Notifications**: The bot periodically checks for upcoming concerts for users' favorite artists and notifies them via Telegram.
3. **Precise Search**: The bot uses the Spotify `attractionId` to ensure only exact matches are found for concerts.
